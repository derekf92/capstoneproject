Tested out several features of the NLP such as tagging and Named Enitity REcognition.
Ran into difficulties generating the actual parse tree. Either Too simple or just wrong.

Did not generate a parse tree that TJ would be able to use.


##James Setola - Voice to Text and Database Maintenance

Successfully receive a raw response from the server that i will translate into a structured response
